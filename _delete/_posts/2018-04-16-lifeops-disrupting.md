## Script 1
### Title
LifeOps - 5 Mistakes You Are Making When Implementing Policy Admin

### Opening
If you are implementing Insurance Policy Administration, you are probably
making these 5 mistakes:

### 1. Users don't know what they want
Generally speaking people know what they don't want more than they
know what they want. It's much easier for them to
express their thoughts when presented with something to reference.

`LifeOps Lab` provides a collaboration tool to help get your people on track
by prototyping functionality and business scenarios quickly in order
to get useful feedback as quickly as possible.

### 2. Your implementation is brittle
Policy Admin has many interconnected moving parts. As
features are added and bugs are fixed, the code can become very easy
to break. Not only that, but it can be difficult to impossible for
a developer to even know he has broken something when a change is made.

The `LifeOps Lab` provides a collaboration tool that allows developers
to run integration tests before changes are committed. This allows for
unprecedented stability because it DOES NOT require a fully
integrated test environment to execute.

### 3. You are recreating your legacy system
It can be hard for people to imagine how functionality might work
with new and unfamiliar technology. Unfortunately, this tends to
lead people into recreating legacy processes that are no longer
ideal.

The interactive `LifeOps Bot` provides a new and unique way to tackle many
Policy Admin business processes such as new business, suspense,
in-force requirements, disbursement approvals, and other common workflows.

Combined with the `LifeOps Lab`, users can see how the `LifeOps Bot`
can be used to solved their business problems by experimenting with
business scenarios and discussing the outcomes with each other.

### 4. Too much hacking
Configuring new products in your Policy Admin software should be as
simple and straightforward as possible. Unfortunately, business
processes tend to have many nuances specific to your own needs. For the majority
of software packages this requires you to shoehorn functionality or
write complicated "workaround" code to accommodate your needs.

The `LifeOps Framework` emphasizes simplicity of configuration and
allows you to plugin or extend only the parts necessary to support
your products and business processes.

### 5. Your wasting time
A lot of time is wasted on projects reproducing defects, troubleshooting problems,
and ensuring changes don't breaking existing features. These tasks should
be minimized and streamlined.

`LifeOps Lab` minimizes wasted time by providing `replay` capability to
the developer. This allows the developer to replay the user's actions in his
own development environment providing valuable tracing feedback for each event.

Once these events are replayed and the issue is fixed, the `LifeOps Lab` keeps
the scenario to ensure future changes do not break the developer's fix.
This greatly reduces time spent ensuring future changes don't break existing
functionality.

### Closing
Implementing Policy Admin that meets your needs can be difficult. These are
the most common traps we see people fall into when taking on the endeavour.

At `LifeOps` we provide Policy Admin software that empowers your team to
work effectively and collaborate with each other.

The powerful combination of the `LifeOps Bot` and `LifeOps Lab` can
help spark new thoughts and ideas within your team that would be
difficult or impossible with other software packages.

these common problems visit http://www.life-ops.com

## Notes
Execution

Advanced Technology

Challenging Status Quo => DISRUPTING

Automated Testing | DevOps | Bots

Agile => distancing / critical of...doing right?

What happens when anyone on your team can deploy the code?

What happens when everyone of your developers can test (not just QA)?

What happens when you minimize your feedback loops?

   How many features can you break with one line of code? When will you find out?

   How can you be agile, when you don't even know what impact a change will have?



ALWAYS BE DELIVERING

Can you change they way you think about development?

Can you change the way you think about productivity?

How efficiently are you using your most productive employees?

Instead of thinking in terms of ROI, why don't we consider how much time is wasted

of your most productive employees is being used?

Does your team get larger or smaller?

What are the added efficiencies of smaller teams vs larger teams?

Observe, Orient, Decide, Act .... Repeat

Insurance companies use Policy Admin software to run their operations.

Adapt your operations or die.

LifeOps is Policy Admin helps you close the OODA Loop:

  Observe

    ## LifeOps lets you observe your operations.
    Observing requires clarity...

  Orient

    FAIL FAST...we want bad new early not later.
    Identify "mismatches"


  Decide



  Act

    EXECUTION...can you execute quickly and correctly?

    LifeOps bot allows anyone to deploy new environments
    LifeOps bot allows for ANYONE on your team to run all tests



Together we can prevail.

"Cras Es Noster"
"Tomorrow Is Ours"

Policy Admin is the heart of an Insurance company.

LifeOps is DISRUPTING the this space by


LifeOps...DISRUPTING Policy Admin


What are your insights?
What insights can we reveal?

we must orient ourselves to the changes we introduce...

-------------------------------------------------------------


Feedback is EVERYTHING...

  How long does it take you to know if a new feature works properly?

  How long does it take you to know fixing one defect caused 10 new defects?

  How long does it take a developer to reproduce an issue once it is discovered in production?

How can you be agile if you haven't CLOSED these feedback loops?

Expand your thinking.


LifeOps Lab
  * Experiment In to Lab => Explore new scenarios to demonstrate new features and functionality
  * Lab Sessions => Gather the team together to record feedback about features and functionality





### Old
Policy Admin software comes in two flavors:
  1. Paramterized
  2. "Rules Engine"

In the first type of software you will end up shoehorning your processes
into the thousands of parameters that have been accumulated over the years.
This leads to confusing and unclear artifacts of your products.

In the second type of software you will effectively be coding your
product business processes with a proprietary language. This code becomes
the products you implement on this software. Because of the lack of consistency
it can
